# easyDAS #

The Distributed Annotation System (DAS) is a protocol to publish and share annotations on biological sequences. Although there are currently more than 400 public servers worldwide, most of them are hosted by medium or large organizations.

In order to set up a DAS server you have to set up an internet accessible machine, install any of the available server implementations and program the apadtor to access your data. While this is an easy task for many organizations, it is a burden that many small and medium sized research groups cannot assume. Those research groups, while willing to make their findings available to the comunity, are often unable to do so.

easyDAS is a web-application for the automated creation of DAS servers and can take care of all those issues. A researcher simply has to upload a data file to the system and a new DAS data source will be automatically created. It is then possible to integrate that data using any of the available DAS clients, including Ensembl, Dasty2...

Data sources can be managed using the same web interface, changing their metadata, updating their content or even deleting them. easyDAS if fully compliant with the latest DAS specification (1.6) and encourages the use use of ontology terms where suitable thanks to its integrated ontology browser based on OLS. easyDAS is open source and is available at http://wwwdev.ebi.ac.uk/panda-srv/easydas/
